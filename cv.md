//You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. 
//The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a 
//single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

function findOutlier(integers){
  let countOdd = 0;
  let countEven = 0;
  for (let i=0; i<3; i++) {
    (integers[i]%2 == 0) ? countOdd++ : countEven++;
    }
  
  if (countOdd > countEven) {
    for (let item of integers) {
      if (item%2 != 0) return item;
    }
